/**
 * Shared decisions for both maps — the preview on 'Nu' and the full radar screen.
 *
 * ## Why MapLibre and not Apple Maps
 *
 * The radar loop is an animation, and Apple Maps could not play one. react-native-maps
 * draws a georeferenced image through AIRMapOverlay, whose image load ends in an
 * `update` that does `[_map removeOverlay:self]; [_map addOverlay:self];`
 * unconditionally. Two things follow from that, and both were visible in the app:
 * a frame unmounted while its image was still loading re-added *itself* afterwards,
 * so stepping the loop stacked every frame it had ever shown; and once a single
 * overlay was reused instead, the remove/add on each step made MapKit re-rasterise
 * the layer, which blanked the map for a beat. Neither has a prop to turn it off,
 * and `Overlay`'s `opacity` — the way you would normally cross-fade frames — is
 * documented as Google Maps only and is never read by the iOS renderer.
 *
 * MapLibre has the piece that was missing: real per-layer opacity. Every frame is
 * mounted once as its own raster layer and a step only flips which one is opaque,
 * so nothing is added, removed, refetched or re-rasterised while the loop plays.
 * That is how the AgroExact RN client animates the same imagery.
 *
 * ## Why the basemap is OpenFreeMap
 *
 * Leaving Apple Maps means bringing a basemap. OpenFreeMap serves OpenStreetMap
 * vector tiles with no API key and no quota, which keeps the app free of a metered
 * third-party account for what is only a backdrop to the radar.
 *
 * Bright in light, Fiord in dark. NOTE: `tiles.openfreemap.org` is unreachable from
 * the build environment (the network policy blocks it), so neither URL below could
 * be requested to confirm its exact slug — nor could the style JSON that
 * `localiseStyle` below rewrites.
 *
 * ## Why the map is clamped at both ends
 *
 * The radar imagery is one image per frame at about a kilometre per pixel, so past
 * the provider's own maximum the map is only scaling it up, and far enough in it is
 * mush. Out at the whole-world levels the basemap has nothing useful to say about a
 * shower over Brabant either. So the camera is held inside a band and every starting
 * view is chosen to sit within it.

// ── Labels in the reader's language ─────────────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * Rewrite a basemap's place labels to prefer one language.
 *
 * MapLibre Native has no "set the map's language" call — `setLanguage` is a thing in
 * the web build and in Mapbox's SDK, not here. The labels live in the style, so the
 * only way to change them is to change the style: fetch it, rewrite the `text-field`
 * of the layers that draw names, and hand MapLibre the result instead of the URL.
 *
 * ## What it asks for, and in what order
 *
 * OpenStreetMap tags a place with `name` in its own local language, and with
 * `name:<lang>` for whatever else has been translated. The OpenMapTiles schema
 * OpenFreeMap uses carries `name`, `name:latin`, `name_int`, and — depending on how
 * the tiles were generated — a set of `name:<lang>` fields.
 *
 * So the chain is: the reader's language, then the local name, then the Latin
 * transliteration. The middle step is the important one and the reason this is worth
 * doing at all: the stock style prefers an international field, which is why a Dutch
 * app labelled the Belgian capital BRUSSELS. Falling back to `name` gives Brussel,
 * Köln and Liège — the names on the road signs — even where no translation exists.
 *
 * ## Which layers are touched
 *
 * Only symbol layers whose `text-field` already mentions a name. A basemap also
 * labels motorway shields with `ref`, contours with `ele` and buildings with a house
 * number, and rewriting those to a name would blank them. The test is deliberately a
 * blunt one — does this expression mention `name` at all — because the alternative is
 * enumerating every layer id of a style this app does not own and cannot see change.
